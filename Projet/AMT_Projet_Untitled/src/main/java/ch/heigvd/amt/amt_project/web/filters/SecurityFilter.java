/**
 * This class implements the Filter interface defined in the Servlet API. A
 * filter is a component that is placed in the (HTTP) request processing
 * pipeline. It can inspect and manipulate both the request (on the way in) and
 * the response (on the way out).
 *
 * The responsibility of this class is to handle authorization of HTTP requests
 * issued by clients. The security policy is defined as follows: - all pages of
 * the application are protected and can be accessed only if the the user has
 * successfully authenticated. If that is the case, then there must be an object
 * named "principal" stored in the HTTP session. - static content (css,
 * javascript, etc.) is not protected - the login page, which displays the login
 * form, is not protected - the authentication servlet, which processes data
 * entered in the login form, is not protected either
 *
 * These rules are enforced in the method. Note that there is no actual password
 * verification. Any password will be accepted in this illustrative scenario.
