## Introduction
This project is to make during the AMT course at the HEIG-VD.

The main goal is to design an web application client-server in Java in 3 parts.

The first part is to create the scaffolding of the application (Account, Application, Role, Api Key) and implementation of the design pattern MVC.

The second part is to

The third part is to

### REST API

### Design patterns
#### MVC
This design pattern separate the code used for presentation from that which works on and handles data

The controller (which is often a Java servlet) oversees the whole application, calling code in the model (often a JavaBean) to handle the internal logic and business rules and then sending the results to the presentation layer, the view (often made up of JSPs), which interacts with the user.

Model: Implements the data crunching of the application. This is the core code that does the application’s internal work. The model doesn’t know anything about the view or the controller — you just pass it data and it goes from there, returning its results. In online Java applications, the model is often implemented using JavaBeans.

View: Implements the presentation layer that interacts with the user. When the user starts interacting with an online Java application, the Web page(s) they see are part of the view. The view also takes data supplied to it (usually from the controller) and displays it. In online Java applications, the view is often implemented using JSP.

Controller: Acts as the boss of the application and is responsible for routing data to the right model and view components. The controller oversees the model and the view by reacting to the data the user sends. In online Java applications, the controller is often implemented as a servlet.

### Selected aspects
The Bootstrap 3 library is used for designed the views.

## Testing and validation

### Tools
#### Apache JMeter
Apache JMeter is an open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test client/server software.

JMeter can be used to simulate a heavy load on a server, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.

User's Manual : [http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/index.html](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/index.html)


#### Selenium
Selenium is a portable software testing framework for web applications.

Selenium provides a record/playback tool for authoring tests without learning a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It also provides a test domain-specific language (Selenese) to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including Java, C#, Groovy, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby. The tests can then be run against most modern web browsers. Selenium deploys on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh platforms. It is open-source software, released under the Apache 2.0 license, and can be downloaded and used without charge.

Documentation : [http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/)

### Test strategy

#### Automated piloting tests

Selenium will be used to simulate user actions such as:

* Login with wrong credentials. It should not work and the user should stay on the same page.
* Login with valid credentials. It should redirect the user to the homepage
* Once logged-in the user should join every pages on the website
* Once logged-in the user should be able to make CRUD operations on the applications.
* Once logged-in the user should be able to make modifications on his profile.

#### Automated heavy load test

JMeter will be used to simulate multiple simultaneous access to the website to check for eventual multi-thread bugs.
Here are the requests that will be executed for each thread:

* Get homepage
* Register random user
* Authentication of this random user
* Get application list
* Add a new application

### Procedures

### Results

### Apache JMeter

The thread group of JMeter tests contains two views to visualize query results. The first, "View results tree" can see requests and responses sent and the other, "Graph Results", lets see the send-response time and other details on the flow, the average or data for example. Other views can be added without worries thread group.

The requests results can be seen in the database.

#### Selenium

When the Selenium project is implemented (in test mode), the NetBeans progress bar shows the percentage of green and red successful tests stranded results.
